## Inspiration

We play Wordle daily. Everyone who has ever played with friends knows the pain of copying and sharing the result with all of them over any messaging app. We were tired of it and decided to create the Wordle League app.

## What it does

Wordle League is an app that lets you create leagues between your friends and share your daily results with them. You just have to upload the output you copy from the Wordle app.

## How we built it

We built it using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).
For the database, we used [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
Deployment with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
Version control with [GitHub](https://github.com).

## Challenges we ran into

The main challenges we ran into were:

- First time with NextJS as a backend technology.
- First time with TailwindCSS.
- Getting used to develop frontends, as we are both more backend side devs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The main functionality of the leagues works exactly as we had planned and solves the problem we were facing. Moreover, adding the challenges section is a _nice to have_ feature which is not fully polished yet.

## What we learned

We have learnt a lot about NextJS and TailwindCSS and also some complex MongoDB queries.
However, we think the most powerful thing is the experience of working together throughout the whole 36h, teamworking, organising and prioritising what to do first.

## What's next for Wordle League

Right now the authentication part is just mocked, so that needs to be implemented. 
The challenges feature also needs to be polished.
